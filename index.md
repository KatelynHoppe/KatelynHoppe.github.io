## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 1
This was my favorite lab because it was our traditional first piece of code. We got to interact with the traditional “Hello World!” code, and was the first time a lot of people in our class had ever touched code. This lab was how we learned to access our terminals, configure git, and use Visual Studio Code.

Lab 12, part 1
This was my second favorite lab because it taught us how to work with the Magick. I especially enjoyed this portion of the lab because it teaches us how to make a gif by animating a gradient. The lab had been challenging, but entertaining.

Lab 6 part 2
This was my third favorite lab because we got to learn about how to play blackjack, how to gamble, got to work with booleans, and if-else statements. Though the lab was challenging, it was entertaining trying to get it to work.
